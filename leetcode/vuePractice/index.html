<!--
when want to pass in args to something you want to also use the event of, pass
in whatever args you want and then pass in $event too to get access to events

even more general, just whenever you wanna access the default JS event object, just use $event
v-on:keydown.enter="value = $event.target.value"

another note on this is that you dont always have to pass in a function to have
these event listeners work, you can just do the code within the quotes like that
note that when in the html, don't have to say this.value just need to say value
whereas in the vue object, you use this when the data spans across data and method objects yadadamean

there are event modifiers to stuff like v-on:whatever
just add a dot modifier to it and you can do stuff like
v-on:mousemove.stop which stops propagation
v-on:click:prevent which prevents default

there is an event modifier for keyup and i assume keydown too where you do something
like this:
v-on:keyup.enter where the modifier is the name of the key youre listening to
can chain as well like v-on:keyup.enter.a.shift

v-model on an input does 2 way binding of the input and the value associated with it
v-model="name" makes it so if you change name, you change the input and vice versa
it's the same as if you did <input type="text" v-bind:value="name" v-on:input="name = $event.target.value" />

for v-html you can't just pass in the html into the argument like
v-html="<p>henlo</p>", looks like you can only pass it in as variable like
v-html="html" where html is a data element with value of <p>henlo</p>

computed options object
can also add computed in addition to el, data, and methods
when interpolating data that relies on logic, might make sense to create
a method that returns a value and interpolate that in the dom using {{ method() }}
the only problem with this is that whenever ANYTHING on the page re-renders,
this method will be called even though whatever was changed may not be
relevant to the method
If the method takes a long time to run, this could negatively affect performance
because you do one little thing and it calls this function needlessly
This is where computed comes in.  Computed is used as a data when interpolating
onto the DOM e.g. {{ computedMethod }} instead of {{ computedMethod() }}
but when writing it out in the object, it still looks like a function.
Computed functions are not always called indiscriminately when something on the
page re-renders.  It is only called when relevant data is changed.  Relevant
data is anything contained or referenced within the computed function.  This
makes it so that when something unrelated rerenders, the computed function would
only run if any of its relvant data is changed, otherwise it will return the
cached previous result.  This saves a lot of time because it does not have
to take time to call the function again but just return this value.
