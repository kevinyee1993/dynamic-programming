<!--
when want to pass in args to something you want to also use the event of, pass
in whatever args you want and then pass in $event too to get access to events

even more general, just whenever you wanna access the default JS event object, just use $event
v-on:keydown.enter="value = $event.target.value"

another note on this is that you dont always have to pass in a function to have
these event listeners work, you can just do the code within the quotes like that
note that when in the html, don't have to say this.value just need to say value
whereas in the vue object, you use this when the data spans across data and method objects yadadamean

there are event modifiers to stuff like v-on:whatever
just add a dot modifier to it and you can do stuff like
v-on:mousemove.stop which stops propagation
v-on:click:prevent which prevents default

there is an event modifier for keyup and i assume keydown too where you do something
like this:
v-on:keyup.enter where the modifier is the name of the key youre listening to
can chain as well like v-on:keyup.enter.a.shift
