<!--
Multiple vue instances

accessing and manipulating vue instances through variables

proxying data when changing vue instance through stored variable

adding ref key to html element like querySelector/not updating template

accessing all refs with this.$refs then selecting specific ref

$mount('cssSelector') working the same as el: 'cssSelector'

template option in vue instance (just a string representing HTML)
    template: '<h1>Hello</h1>'  -> no object or anything

components -> will dive deeper into it later

Vue has virtual DOM similar to React which makes updating a lot faster

Vue lifecycle methods
you add the hooks as part of the Vue options hash
el: '#app',
data: {
  whatever: 'whatever'
},
beforeCreate: function() {  <-- add lifecycle method in like this
  // whatever code here
}
note that they are always functions



Can have multiple vue instances on same page
can store each vue instance in a variable and then access that e.g.
const app = new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    hello: 'hello'
  }
}
})

app.hello = "farts" changes the data hello, notice you don't have to say
app.data.hello, can direclty use the name
if you did wanna do it like that, you would use app.$data.hello, $data being
the field of the Vue instance which holds all the data

when using $mount('#app'), does same thing as el: '#app' just that you use
it when a vue instance does not have that app option, and you do it after
that vue instance is created.  just mounting the vue template onto an
html element.  Useful for when you wanna set up a vue instance first but
not sure where to mount it yet or if the html element doesn't exist yet

will dive deeper into components but what ive seen so far, need to declare it
like:
Vue.component('componentName', {
  options hash similar but not identical to vue instance's options hash
})
declare it outside of any vue instances just in the JS but above any vue instance
that controls the html that you wanna put the component inside of
then anywhere in html you can put <componentName></componentName> to show that
component with predefined template
can't put <componentName></componentName> in just the html, need to put it
into an HTML element controlled by a vue instance

Vue uses virtual DOM to keep track of updating/rerendering.  Vue instance
creates a virtual DOM which it keeps track of and whenever something changes in
the Vue instance, it changes it in the virtual DOM.  It then finds any
differences between the Vue instance and the virtual DOM and those differences
are the ones that get updated in the regular DOM.  Now the real DOM and virtual
DOM would have the same representation without having to do anything else like
copying over the real DOM over to the virtual DOM.  Makes updating very fast
