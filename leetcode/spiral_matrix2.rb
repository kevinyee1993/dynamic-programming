  # first line aka first array is always 1..n

end

# start by initializing an N x N 2d array filled with undefineds

# have a function called change directions which takes 2 params
# change_directions(curr_direction, count)
# there will be 4 directions: left, down, right, up
# depending on the current direction, the direction switches to the next one
# in the sequence
# the count starts at one and keeps incrementing and being placed in

# if reach the boundary of the 2d array or hit a number, change direction
# and proceed adding numbers

# stop once you place n^2 into the value

# this approach will be O(n^2) time and space because have to create
# the 2d array as well as place each element in given a starting value of n
